The project name : finance calculator
the aime of this project is to create a program for a small financial company that allows the user to access two different financial calculators:
an investment calculator and a home loan repayment calculator.

How the user capitalises their selection should not affect how the
program proceeds. i.e. ‘Bond’, ‘bond’, ‘BOND’ or ‘investment’, ‘Investment’,
‘INVESTMENT’, etc., should all be recognised as valid entries. If the user
doesn’t type in a valid input, show an appropriate error message.

● If the user selects ‘investment’, do the following:
 then Ask the user to input:
○ The amount of money that they are depositing.
○ The interest rate (as a percentage). Only the number of the interest
rate should be entered — don’t worry about having to deal with the
added ‘%’, e.g. The user should enter 8 and not 8%.
○ The number of years they plan on investing.
○ Then ask the user to input if they want “simple” or “compound”
interest, and store this in a variable called interest. Depending on
whether or not they typed “simple” or “compound”, output the
appropriate amount that they will get back after the given period,
at the specified interest rate. and at the end , Calculate how much money the user will have to repay each month
and output the answer.
